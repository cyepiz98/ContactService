#How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
#How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
#How do I approach designing software?

#To make sure my code is functional and secure, I rely on disciplined unit testing, boundary validation and defensive programming. I write tests that cover both valid and 
#invalid inputs and use assertions like assertThrows and assertEquals to confirm the system behaves as expected under stress. I treat every test like a job site inspection. I 
#break it down, check every edge and make sure nothing slips through. When interpreting user needs, I focus on what the system must allow, reject and protect. I break 
#requirements into clear constraints and test cases just like I do in construction or retail when adapting to changing conditions. My approach to designing software is 
#modular and practical. I start with the core logic, isolate each component and build in validation from the start. Whether I am writing a service class or a test suite, I 
#think ahead to prevent bugs, enforce rules and make sure the code can handle real world use. These projects helped me connect my hands on mindset to software quality and I 
#now feel confident building systems that are reliable and maintainable.
